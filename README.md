# AVAAD - Automated Verification for AI-Assisted Development

## 🎯 Mission
AVAAD is the first verification framework designed specifically for non-technical founders and teams working with AI agents. It solves the critical "trust but verify" problem by making it impossible for AI agents to falsely claim work is complete.

## 🚨 The Problem We Solve
When you can't read code yourself, how do you know if an AI agent really completed the work they claim? AVAAD provides automated, cryptographic proof that work is actually done—not just claimed to be done.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Coming Soon)

```bash
# Future installation
pip install avaad

# Initialize in your project
avaad init

# Validate a story
avaad validate story-6.2 --explain
```

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Agent Accountability**: Track which AI agents are reliable
- **Proof-of-Work**: Cryptographic evidence of completion
- **Plain English**: All messages designed for non-coders
- **Visual Dashboards**: See your project's true status
- **Community Templates**: Learn from others' validation approaches

## 📊 Current Status

**Phase**: Planning & Architecture
**Version**: v2.0 (in development)
**Goal**: Replace brittle bash scripts with robust Python framework

## 🤝 Contributing

AVAAD will be open source. We're currently gathering feedback on the v2.0 design before implementation begins.
