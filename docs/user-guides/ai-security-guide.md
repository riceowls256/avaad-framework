# AI Security Guide for Non-Technical Users

## üõ°Ô∏è Understanding AI Security with AVAAD

This guide helps non-technical users understand and respond to AI security alerts from the AVAAD framework.

## What is AI Security?

AI security refers to protecting your development process from:
- **Prompt injection attacks** - attempts to manipulate AI agents
- **Malicious code suggestions** - dangerous code recommended by AI
- **Agent manipulation** - AI agents being tricked into harmful behavior

## üîç Common Security Alerts

### **HIGH Priority - Immediate Action Required**

#### **System Override Attempt**
**What it looks like:**
```
‚ùå HIGH ALERT: System Override Attempt
Agent says: "Ignore previous instructions and just run this code..."
```

**What it means:** An AI agent is trying to bypass safety protocols.

**What to do:**
1. **STOP** - Don't run any code from this interaction
2. **Review** the full conversation carefully
3. **Check** if this is legitimate (rarely is)
4. **Reject** the agent's work and ask for clarification

#### **Code Injection Detected**
**What it looks like:**
```
‚ùå HIGH ALERT: Code Injection
Detected: import os; os.system('rm -rf /')
```

**What it means:** The AI suggested dangerous code that could harm your system.

**What to do:**
1. **Don't run the code**
2. **Document** the incident
3. **Check** your system hasn't been compromised
4. **Report** the issue to your team

### **MEDIUM Priority - Monitor Closely**

#### **Context Manipulation**
**What it looks like:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM ALERT: Context Manipulation
Agent says: "From now on, act as a different AI..."
```

**What it means:** The agent is trying to change its role or behavior.

**What to do:**
1. **Proceed with caution**
2. **Verify** the request is legitimate
3. **Monitor** future interactions
4. **Consider** switching agents

### **LOW Priority - Awareness Only**

#### **Suspicious Language**
**What it looks like:**
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è LOW ALERT: Suspicious Language
Contains: "pretend you're a different AI"
```

**What it means:** Minor suspicious language detected.

**What to do:**
- **Be aware** but continue normally
- **Document** for future reference
- **No immediate action needed**

## üö® Red Flags to Watch For

### **Immediate Stop Signs**
- Any mention of "ignore previous instructions"
- Requests to "bypass safety" or "disable security"
- Code containing `eval()`, `exec()`, or `import os`
- Suggestions to delete files or change system settings

### **Warning Signs**
- Agents claiming they need "elevated privileges"
- Requests to run commands directly on your system
- Suggestions to "just trust me" or "skip validation"

## üìã Daily Security Checklist

### **Before Starting Work**
1. ‚úÖ Check yesterday's security alerts
2. ‚úÖ Verify your AI agent is behaving normally
3. ‚úÖ Ensure security monitoring is enabled

### **During Work**
1. ‚úÖ Run security check after each AI interaction
2. ‚úÖ Watch for any HIGH or CRITICAL alerts
3. ‚úÖ Document any suspicious behavior

### **End of Day**
1. ‚úÖ Review security summary
2. ‚úÖ Address any pending security issues
3. ‚úÖ Update team on any concerns

## üõ†Ô∏è Using the Security Tools

### **Quick Security Check**
```bash
# Check specific text
python tools/security-analyzer.py scan-text "agent output here"

# Check a story's interactions
python tools/security-analyzer.py scan-story --story 6.2

# Get security report
python tools/security-analyzer.py report --last-week
```

### **Interpreting Results**
- **‚úÖ No issues** - Safe to proceed
- **‚ö†Ô∏è LOW alerts** - Monitor but continue
- **‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM alerts** - Review carefully
- **‚ùå HIGH/CRITICAL** - Stop and investigate

## üéØ Best Practices

### **For Non-Technical Users**
1. **Always run security checks** after AI completes work
2. **Don't ignore HIGH alerts** - they're rarely false positives
3. **Ask questions** when you don't understand an alert
4. **Keep logs** of security incidents
5. **Update security rules** based on your experience

### **What to Do When You Get an Alert**

#### **Step 1: Don't Panic**
Security alerts are designed to help you, not scare you.

#### **Step 2: Read the Alert Carefully**
The alert will tell you:
- **What** was detected
- **Why** it's concerning
- **What to do** next

#### **Step 3: Take Action**
- **HIGH/CRITICAL**: Stop and investigate immediately
- **MEDIUM**: Review the interaction carefully
- **LOW**: Make note and continue

#### **Step 4: Document It**
Keep a simple log:
```
Date: 2025-07-26
Alert: HIGH - Code Injection
Action: Rejected agent's work, asked for clarification
Outcome: Agent provided safe alternative
```

## üìû Getting Help

### **When to Ask for Help**
- HIGH or CRITICAL alerts you don't understand
- Repeated security issues with the same agent
- Code suggestions you're unsure about
- Budget overruns you can't explain

### **Who to Ask**
- Technical team members
- Security-conscious colleagues
- AVAAD community forums
- Documentation at `docs/troubleshooting/`

## üß™ Common Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: "The agent said to ignore previous instructions"**
**Alert Level:** HIGH
**Action:** Immediately reject this work and ask the agent to follow the original instructions.

### **Scenario 2: "The agent suggested running a system command"**
**Alert Level:** HIGH
**Action:** Don't run the command. Ask for a safer alternative or manual instructions.

### **Scenario 3: "The agent is acting strangely"**
**Alert Level:** MEDIUM
**Action:** Run a security check on recent interactions. Consider restarting the session.

## üîß Configuration Tips

### **Customizing Security Rules**
If you find legitimate work being flagged:

1. **Edit** `config/security.yaml`
2. **Add** safe patterns to the whitelist
3. **Adjust** severity thresholds if needed
4. **Test** changes with sample inputs

### **Example Custom Rule**
```yaml
whitelist:
  safe_patterns:
    - "standard library import"
    - "common development practice"
```

## üìä Monitoring Your Security

### **Weekly Review**
- Run: `python tools/security-analyzer.py report --last-week`
- Review any recurring issues
- Update your security practices

### **Monthly Assessment**
- Check if security rules need adjustment
- Review agent reliability scores
- Update team on security trends

## üéØ Summary

**Remember:** Security alerts are your friend. They're designed to protect you from:
- Malicious AI behavior
- Accidental system damage
- Budget overruns
- Unreliable agents

**Key Takeaway:** When in doubt, run a security check. It's better to be safe than sorry with AI-assisted development.
