# AI Cost Management Guide for Non-Technical Users

## 💰 Understanding AI Costs with AVAAD

This guide helps non-technical users understand and manage AI agent costs using the AVAAD cost tracking system.

## Why Track AI Costs?

**Real problems we've seen:**
- One user spent $200 in a single day on AI assistance
- Another paid $50 for a simple bug fix that should have cost $2
- Teams discovering $1000+ monthly bills they didn't expect

**AVAAD cost tracking prevents these issues by:**
- **Real-time monitoring** of spending
- **Budget alerts** before you exceed limits
- **ROI analysis** to see which agents provide value
- **Model comparison** to choose the most cost-effective options

## 🎯 Understanding the Basics

### **What Costs Money?**

**Input tokens**: What you send to the AI (your questions, code, requirements)
**Output tokens**: What the AI sends back (answers, code, explanations)

**Typical costs per 1000 tokens:**
- **Claude Sonnet**: $0.003 input + $0.015 output
- **GPT-4o**: $0.005 input + $0.015 output  
- **GPT-4o Mini**: $0.00015 input + $0.0006 output

### **Real-World Examples**

| Task | Typical Cost | Tokens Used |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| Simple bug fix | $0.10-$0.50 | 500-2,000 |
| Code review | $0.20-$1.00 | 1,000-5,000 |
| Feature implementation | $1.00-$5.00 | 5,000-25,000 |
| Large refactoring | $5.00-$15.00 | 25,000-100,000 |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Step 1: Check Current Costs**
```bash
# See your current spending
python tools/cost-reporter.py budget --daily

# Get a weekly summary
python tools/cost-reporter.py report --last-week
```

### **Step 2: Set Your Budgets**

Edit `config/cost-tracking.yaml`:

```yaml
budgets:
  daily: 10.0      # $10 per day max
  weekly: 50.0     # $50 per week max
  monthly: 200.0   # $200 per month max
```

### **Step 3: Start Tracking**

Every time an AI agent works on your project:
```bash
# Log an interaction manually
python tools/cost-reporter.py add-cost claude-sonnet-4 1000 200 --story 6.2 --description "Fixed login bug"
```

## 📊 Understanding Your Reports

### **Reading Cost Reports**

**Example output:**
```
💰 AVAAD AI Cost Report
Period: Last 7 days
Total Spend: $23.45
Interactions: 12
Average per interaction: $1.95

📊 By Agent:
  claude-code: $15.20
  gpt-4o: $8.25

🤖 By Model:
  claude-sonnet-4: $15.20
  gpt-4o: $8.25

📋 Top Stories:
  story-6.2: $8.50
  story-5.1: $6.75
  story-4.3: $4.20
```

### **Interpreting the Data**

**Good signs:**
- Costs under $2 per simple task
- Daily spending under $10
- Positive ROI scores
- Consistent model usage

**Warning signs:**
- Single tasks costing > $10
- Daily spending approaching budget limits
- Negative ROI scores
- Rapidly increasing costs

## 🎯 Setting Smart Budgets

### **Recommended Budgets by Project Size**

| Project Type | Daily Budget | Weekly Budget | Monthly Budget |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| Solo side project | $5-10 | $25-50 | $100-200 |
| Small team (2-3 people) | $15-25 | $75-125 | $300-500 |
| Medium team (5-8 people) | $30-50 | $150-250 | $600-1000 |
| Large team (10+ people) | $50-100 | $250-500 | $1000-2000 |

### **Budget Alert Thresholds**

Set alerts at 80% of your budget:
```yaml
alerts:
  daily_warning: 8.0     # 80% of $10 daily budget
  daily_critical: 9.0    # 90% of $10 daily budget
```

## 📈 Understanding ROI

### **What is ROI?**
Return on Investment (ROI) measures if AI costs are worth the value you get.

**Formula:**
```
ROI = (Value of AI work - AI cost) / AI cost * 100
```

### **Interpreting ROI Scores**

| ROI Score | What it Means | Action |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| +200% or more | Excellent value | Continue using this approach |
| +50% to +200% | Good value | You're on the right track |
| 0% to +50% | Moderate value | Consider optimization |
| Negative | Losing money | Review your AI usage |

### **Real ROI Examples**

**Good ROI:**
```
Story 6.2: Fixed complex bug
- AI Cost: $3.50
- Time saved: 2 hours
- Developer value: $100 (2 hrs × $50/hr)
- ROI: 2757% ✅
```

**Poor ROI:**
```
Story 5.1: Simple documentation
- AI Cost: $8.00
- Time saved: 15 minutes
- Developer value: $12.50 (0.25 hrs × $50/hr)
- ROI: -84% ❌
```

## 🛠️ Daily Cost Management

### **Morning Routine**
```bash
# Check yesterday's costs
python tools/cost-reporter.py report --days 1

# Check current budget status
python tools/cost-reporter.py budget --daily
```

### **Before Major AI Work**
```bash
# Estimate cost for a big task
python tools/cost-reporter.py add-cost gpt-4o 5000 1000 --story "estimate" --description "Large feature estimate"
```

### **End of Week Review**
```bash
# Weekly cost summary
python tools/cost-reporter.py report --last-week

# Check model efficiency
python tools/cost-reporter.py efficiency

# Review ROI for completed stories
python tools/cost-reporter.py roi story-6.2
```

## 🎯 Cost Optimization Strategies

### **1. Choose the Right Model**

**For simple tasks:** GPT-4o Mini ($0.00015/1K tokens)
**For complex tasks:** Claude Sonnet ($0.003/1K tokens)
**For critical work:** GPT-4o ($0.005/1K tokens)

### **2. Optimize Prompts**

**Before:**
```
"Can you please help me understand this code and maybe fix any issues you find and also add some tests if possible?"
```
**Cost:** ~$0.50

**After:**
```
"Fix bug in login() function, add 2 tests"
```
**Cost:** ~$0.15

### **3. Batch Related Work**

**Instead of:** 5 separate interactions ($2.50 total)
**Do:** One comprehensive interaction ($1.00 total)

### **4. Use Cost-Efficient Workflows**

**Smart workflow:**
1. Use GPT-4o Mini for initial draft ($0.10)
2. Use Claude Sonnet for refinement ($0.30)
3. **Total:** $0.40 instead of $1.50

## 📋 Common Cost Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: "My daily budget is almost gone"**

**Check:**
```bash
python tools/cost-reporter.py budget --daily
```

**Solutions:**
- Switch to smaller models (GPT-4o Mini)
- Batch remaining work
- Postpone non-critical tasks
- Review if costs are justified

### **Scenario 2: "This story seems too expensive"**

**Investigate:**
```bash
python tools/cost-reporter.py roi story-6.2
```

**Actions:**
- If ROI is negative: simplify the approach
- If ROI is positive: accept the cost
- Consider breaking into smaller tasks

### **Scenario 3: "One model is much more expensive"**

**Compare:**
```bash
python tools/cost-reporter.py efficiency
```

**Decision:**
- If expensive model has better ROI: keep using it
- If cheaper model works: switch to save money
- If similar quality: choose cheaper option

## 🎯 Setting Up Your First Budget

### **Step 1: Start Small**
```yaml
budgets:
  daily: 5.0     # $5 per day
  weekly: 25.0   # $25 per week
  monthly: 100.0 # $100 per month
```

### **Step 2: Monitor for 2 Weeks**
```bash
python tools/cost-reporter.py report --last-week
python tools/cost-reporter.py report --days 14
```

### **Step 3: Adjust Based on Usage**
- If consistently under budget: increase limits
- If hitting limits: optimize usage
- If wildly over: investigate causes

### **Step 4: Set Alerts**
```yaml
alerts:
  daily_warning: 4.0    # 80% of $5
  daily_critical: 4.5   # 90% of $5
```

## 📊 Monthly Review Process

### **End of Month Checklist**
1. **Total spending** vs budget
2. **ROI by story** - which were worth it?
3. **Model efficiency** - which performed best?
4. **Budget adjustments** - need to change limits?

### **Monthly Report Command**
```bash
python tools/cost-reporter.py report --days 30
```

### **Questions to Ask**
- Which AI agents provided the best value?
- Which stories had the highest ROI?
- Where can we optimize costs?
- Do budget limits need adjustment?
